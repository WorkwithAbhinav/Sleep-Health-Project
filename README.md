# Sleep Quality Prediction with Machine Learning

## Overview
Sleep quality is a crucial aspect of a healthy lifestyle, yet many individuals struggle with sleep disorders. This project aims to leverage artificial intelligence and machine learning models to predict the likelihood of a person having a sleep disorder based on various factors.

## Dataset
The dataset used for training and testing the model includes the following features:

- **Person ID:** An identifier for each individual.
- **Gender:** The gender of the person (Male/Female).
- **Age:** The age of the person in years.
- **Occupation:** The occupation or profession of the person.
- **Sleep Duration (hours):** The number of hours the person sleeps per day.
- **Quality of Sleep (scale: 1-10):** A subjective rating of the quality of sleep, ranging from 1 to 10.
- **Physical Activity Level (minutes/day):** The number of minutes the person engages in physical activity daily.
- **Stress Level (scale: 1-10):** A subjective rating of the stress level experienced by the person, ranging from 1 to 10.
- **BMI Category:** The BMI category of the person (e.g., Underweight, Normal, Overweight).
- **Blood Pressure (systolic/diastolic):** The blood pressure measurement of the person, indicated as systolic pressure over diastolic pressure.
- **Heart Rate (bpm):** The resting heart rate of the person in beats per minute.
- **Daily Steps:** The number of steps the person takes per day.
- **Sleep Disorder:** The presence or absence of a sleep disorder in the person (None, Insomnia, Sleep Apnea).

## Machine Learning Model
We have employed a machine learning model that has been trained on a set of training data and tested on a separate set of test data. The model predicts whether a person has a sleep disorder based on the input features.
